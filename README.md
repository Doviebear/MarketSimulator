This is a market simulator. Converted from a school project with a different wrapper.

To use, feed in a csv file with market data on buy and sell orders, and the simulator will match buyers and sellers.

You can enable a watcher that will find the best theorectical trades from the data set to make the best margin using the -w flag.

You can enable a median output that will output the size of the median deal in BTC using the -m flag.

This project can be easily modified to accept different input formats.
